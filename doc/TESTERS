HOW TO TEST PEAR SERVICES_HATENA
================================

$Id$


INTRODUCTION
============

These are instructions for testing PEAR Services_Hatena on a Windows 
machine using a Cygwin Bash shell.
Adjust the paths and commands to match your system.
This configuration is used because these precise steps are known to work.

NOTE:  You must log on as a user which has permissions to modify the
contents of your PHP executable's directory.  This is necessary for both
configuring AND running the test system.

INSTALLATION
============

Obtain PHP's Test Framework
---------------------------
If you don't have PHP's test framework, you need to obtain it.  These
steps include changing the working directory, downloading run-tests.php
via CVS and copying the file into place.  Change the revision flag in the
CVS command as appropriate for your present version of PHP.

 cd c:/progra~1/php
 cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository login   # password is phpfi
 cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository co -r PHP_4_3 \
     -d test php-src/run-tests.php
 cp test/run-tests.php .
 rm -rf test

Obtain Sevices_Hatena and its Test Framework
--------------------------------------------
* IF PEAR SERVICES_HATENA IS ALREADY INSTALLED:

  If you have PEAR Services_Hatena installed already, good.  The test suite
  is in place.  Open up a command/shell prompt and move into
  the test directory.

   cd <path to pear insall>/tests/Services_Hatena/tests

  We assume you already have the PEAR base package installed.  If
  you don't, you will need to do so, but the instructions for
  doing that are beyond the scope of this document.  See
  http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.php for more info.

  Move to the test directory.

   cd pear/Services_Hatena/tests

Copy the Starter Shell Script and Edit the Paths
------------------------------------------------
Please, check README.TESTING, run-tests.php.
[INFO] http://qa.php.net/running-tests.php


Results and What To Do With Them
--------------------------------
Each test that fails generates a .php (which you can execute), a .exp
(the expected output), a .out (the test output) and a .diff (a diff -u
from the .exp and .out files).

If you run the tests, please report or fill the TEST CONFORMANCE table
in the STATUS document.  Before any commit to CVS be sure to run the
tests and nothing got broken with the change.
